# FusionGenesProjectGuillaume-MOABI
Project that consists in studying various tools for gene fusion analysis : fusionfusion, SplitFusion, Factera (Intergene and Interexon), Breakdancer and Lumpy-sv.
First, a script that executes the tools consecutively was made (Batch5tools.sh).
Then, a script that parses data coming from the output files of each tool was developed (ParsingScript.py). See report for more information.
